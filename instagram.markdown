- Experience is what matters, try your best to get it first-hand.
- Initial intern at a startup which made me(Kevin) interested in starting my own company
- First myth: You can learn to be entrepreneur from a book, blog or talk
  - Reality:
    - One day at job > 1yr of learning online
    - Experience teaches you to make better decisions with limited data
    - Its easy to be caught up in the meta part of entreprenuership: like attending startups events
    - The truth: You're never ready, but thats the fun part
    - The only thing that matters: How users like your product
    - You can ship products without having a computer science degree
- Second Myth: Startups can only be started by computer science students
  - Reality:
    - Early twitter team never went to college, Kevin and I didnt major in CS
    - Sink or swim school of engineering
    - Generalists are perfects for startups
    - Find co-founders that complement you
- Third Myth: Finding the solution to the problem is the hardest part
  - Reality:
    - Finding the problem to solve is the hardest part
    - Its easy to build solutions to problems no one have
    - How do you know if you're solving the right problems?
    - It's ok to solve simple problems
    - Once you've made a solution to a problem, its really necessary to find out if people really have that problem. Best way to get this done is to get the product out in front of the users
    - Scaling a product which solves a simple problem is a hard problem
- Fourth Myth: Work for months building a robust product in secrecy, then launch to the world
  - Reality:
    - Problem with stealth startups: esp for consumer internet, you dont feedback when you should have. Putting in front of people is the most learning experience.
    - Building a MVP is really important.
    - Fail early and often, make failing as low cost as possible.
    - Your job: fail your way to success
- Fifth Myth: Start a bidding war among VCs with a slick pitch deck
  - Reality:
    - Raise only what you need to get off the ground(not that much)
    - Optimize for people, not valuation
    - Focus on a prototype and traction, not a fancy pitch deck
    - You dont need a lot of money to get started.
- Sixth Myth: Starting a company is building a product
  - Reality:
    - Starting a company is 50% building a product and 50% other stuff
    - Recruiting, building and managing a team
    - Raising capital
    - Bank accounts, Taxes, forms, insurance, etc. 
- Seventh Myth: Successful startups come from a single great idea
  - Reality:
    - You dont need a great idea, just keep looking in the solution space, until you can find something that you can do better
    - Themes will follow you
    - Sharing and discussing helps
- Eight Myth: Greate startups happen overnight
  - Reality:
    - Overnight successes take 5 years
    - Success comes from the foundations you've built along the way
    - Even with the right idea, you're fighting to the next hill
    - Success can seem obvious, but in reality it's never that clear
    - Its a long slog!
- Best time to start is now!
- Hunger to build stuff and putting in front of people is awesome
- Work life balance is super important. There are things you need to give up, there are distractions you need to remove.

- Experience is what matters
- Wanted to intern in startup which made them interested in starting their own company
- First myth: You can learn to be entrepreneur from a book, blog or talk
  - One day at job > 1yr of learning online
  - Experience teaches you to make better decisions with limited data
  - Its easy to be caught up in the meta part of entreprenuership: like attending startups events
  - The truth: You're never ready, but thats the fun part
  - The only thing that matters: How users like your product
  - You can ship products without having a computer science degree
- Second Myth: Startups can only be started by computer science students
  - Early twitter team never went to college, Kevin and I didnt major in CS
  - Sink or swim school of engineering
  - Generalists are perfects for startups
  - Find co-founders that complement you
- Third Myth: Finding the solution to the problem is the hardest part
  - Finding the problem to solve is the hardest part
  - Its easy to build solutions to problems no one have
  - How do you know if you're solving the right problems?
  - It's ok to solve simple problems
  - Once you've made a solution to a problem, its really necessary to find out if people really have that problem. Best way to get this done is to get the product out in front of the users
  - Scaling a product which solves a simple problem is a hard problem
- Fourth Myth: Work for months building a robust product in secrecy, then launch to the world
  - Problem with stealth startups: esp for consumer internet, you dont feedback when you should have. Putting in front of people is the most learning experience.
  - Building a MVP is really important.
  - Fail early and often, make failing as low cost as possible.
  - Your job: fail your way to success
- Fifth Myth: Start a bidding war among VCs with a slick pitch deck
  - Raise only what you need to get off the ground(not that much)
  - Optimize for people, not valuation
  - Focus on a prototype and traction, not a fancy pitch deck
  - You dont need a lot of money to get started.
- Sixth Myth: Starting a company is building a product
  - Starting a company is 50% building a product and 50% other stuff
  - Recruiting, building and managing a team
  - Raising capital
  - Bank accounts, Taxes, forms, insurance, etc. 
- Seventh Myth: Successful startups come from a single great idea
  - You dont need a great idea, just keep looking in the solution space, until you can find something that you can do better
  - Themes will follow you
  - Sharing and discussing helps
- Eight Myth: Greate startups happen overnight
  - Overnight successes take 5 years
  - Success comes from the foundations you've built along the way
  - Even with the right idea, you're fighting to the next hill
  - Success can seem obvious, but in reality it's never that clear
  - Its a long slog!
- Best time so start is now!
- Hunger to build stuff and putting in front of people is awesome
- Work life balance is super important. There are things you need to give up, there are distractions you need to remove.
